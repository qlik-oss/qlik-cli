    <releaseNotes>## Release notes

- feat: New OAuth-client command-category
The oauth-client API allows you to create more modes of authentication which can be very
useful for automating tasks or, through qlik-embed, embedding content.
Examine the new commands under:
```bash
qlik oauth-client
```
For more information about OAuth-clients go to [help.qlik.com](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Admin/mc-create-oauth-client.htm).
- feat: New automation-connections command
Automations allow you to chain tasks and easily integrate with external systems. Automation-connections
represent the connections that you've made.
You'll find the new commands under:
```bash
qlik automation-connections
```
- feat: Extract more app-properties on the `qlik app unbuild` command.
- feat: CSRF-support for QSEoW
In the near future there will be a security fix for QlikSense Enterprise on Windows making
it a requirement to include a CSRF-token when establishing websocket connections. This adds
a forwards-compatible fix for that.
- fix: Minor description fixes
- feat!: Removing csp-header command
This endpoint has been deprecated and now removed from the help interface, although technically
still usable to not break backwards compatability. An equivalent command is found at: `qlik csp-origin generate-header`</releaseNotes>
