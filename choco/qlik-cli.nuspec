    <releaseNotes>## Release notes

This release includes a major revision of the internal generator which builds
part of Qlik CLI based on our OpenAPI specifications.
1. The set of commands available for Qlik CLI will match those 
available on [qlik.dev](https://qlik.dev) much more closely.
2. We have solved some technical limitations with mapping payload specifications to flags,
meaning that virtually all properties of a payload are now settable as flags instead
of plain JSON (which was the previous fallback). A common painpoint this addresses is
`patch` operations, which usually take an array of JSON-objects.
For example, you can now do:
```
qlik space patch SPACE_ID --op replace --path /description --value "New and improved!"
```
In this example, the `--op`, `--path` and `--value` flags can be used repeatedly and will
then correspond with that property of the nth object. Meaning, a second `--op` flag would
set the `.op` property of the second object.
**Note**: The previous syntax using the `--body` flag is still supported.
The following top-level commands have been added:
- `qlik assistant` - Assistants provide a chat interface for asking questions and getting personalized, relevant answers for Qlik Answers.
- `qlik condition` - Conditions are used by features such as data alerting and subscriptions to determine when action should be taken, based on data in a Qlik app.
- `qlik data-alert` - Supports chart sharing, chart monitoring and alerting features. The legacy sharing APIs refer to chart sharing and chart monitoring, which is a feature that allows the user to send an e-mail with an embedded chart either manually (chart sharing) or in a recurring manner (chart monitoring). It also stores the history related to these actions. The alerting/ data-alerts APIs support the alerting feature, where a user is able to create alerts that trigger notifications in case a condition in the dataset of an app is fulfilled.
- `qlik data-asset` - Data assets are part of the catalog in Qlik Cloud. A data asset is a member of a data store, and may contain multiple data sets.
- `qlik data-connection` - Data connections are used by analytics apps and gateways to connect to external data sources. Credentials are stored in data-credentials.
- `qlik data-credential` - Data credentials are the stored credentials leveraged by the data-connections service to connect to external data sources.
- `qlik data-quality` - API for triggering data quality computations and retrieving global results to assess the quality of your datasets.
- `qlik data-set` - Data sets are part of the catalog in Qlik Cloud. A data set is a member of a data asset.
- `qlik data-source` - Lists data sources available on the tenant for the creation of analytics data connections.
- `qlik data-store` - Data stores are part of the catalog in Qlik Cloud. A data store may contain one or more data stores, which in turn may contain multiple data sets.
- `qlik di-project` - Data integration projects are containers for data tasks and provide the context for building, monitoring, and controlling data integration pipelines.
- `qlik encryption` - Tenants in Qlik Cloud can be encrypted with a key you provide via a supported KMS. This API allows you to configure and manage encryption keys.
- `qlik knowledgebase` - Knowledgebases are collections of individual data sources, that are indexed for use in generating responses to user questions via Assistants for Qlik Answers.
- `qlik ml` - The Machine Learning API allows you to generate profile insights to analyze datasets, create and manage machine learning experiments, deploy models, and run predictions.
- `qlik notification` - Notifications is the resource representing the various notifications that notification-prep can render
- `qlik report` - Reports are downloadable assets generated from data in analytics applications.
- `qlik report-template` - Create and manage report-templates
- `qlik sharing-task` - For scheduled capabilities such as reports, data alerts, subscriptions, and more, sharing tasks defines when these tasks execute, and tie together the resource definition with any conditions on execution.
- `qlik task` - API for managing tasks and task chains in Qlik Cloud. The requesting user needs the "reload" permission on the target resource to use this set of endpoints. A tenant admin can use GET /v1/tasks and DELETE /v1/tasks/{id} to perform administrative actions, even without the "reload" permission.
- `qlik ui-config` - Pinned links are administrator-defined URLs which appear for all users under the More button in the global navigation menu.
- `qlik web-notification` - Web notifications is the resource representing a user's notification
The following unused commands have been removed:
- `qlik data-file space-stats`
- `qlik identity-provider auth-secrets`
- `qlik note settings create` - Use `qlik note settings update` (or `edit`) instead.
- `qlik user metadata` - Underlying endpoint removed, use `qlik role ls` instead.</releaseNotes>
